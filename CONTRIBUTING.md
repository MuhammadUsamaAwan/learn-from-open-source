# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our GitHub repository. The main goal of this repository is to create a comprehensive list of open-source projects that can serve as learning materials for developers implementing similar features in their applications.

Before contributing, please ensure you have read through and follow the guidelines below.

## How to Contribute

Create a new pull request with the relevant changes. The quickest way to do this is directly from the GitHub website. No need to clone the repo locally.

## Adding a New Project

To add a new project, you need to edit the README.md file and include the project in the 'Projects' section. Follow the format of the existing projects. Consider the following:

- The repo should contain real-world apps. Please do not add mini demos or tutorials. The objective is to provide production apps for learning.
- Add the project to the relevant sections. If you think a new section is needed for your project, feel free to add it. Remember, sections should be for major parts of an app, not minor packages or libraries.

## Contact

If you have any questions about contributing or need help with something, feel free to open an issue or send a direct message. 

We look forward to your contributions, and we appreciate your support in our aim to make learning from real-world projects accessible to everyone!
